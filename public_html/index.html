        <p>Powderworkers used to meet in one place only. Now the community meets in more than one place, as the times change and technical community platforms emerge.</p>
        <p>If you are a community of Powderworkers thriving outside of these, you are welcome to mail the webadmin to ask to list your community here.</p>
